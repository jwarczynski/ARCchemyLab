# ARCchemyLab ðŸ”®

Welcome to **ARCchemyLab**, where we explore novel approaches to solving the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** challenge. Join us as we experiment with abstract puzzles and turn them into gold with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“š About the ARC Challenge

The **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** is a challenging dataset introduced by FranÃ§ois Chollet. It consists of a collection of tasks designed to assess a system's ability to reason and generalize abstract patterns. These tasks involve transforming grid-based input into expected output based on a set of examples, requiring a blend of logic, abstraction, and creativity.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

Our goal is to design and implement innovative solutions for solving ARC tasks by:
- **Exploring** various AI/ML approaches for abstract reasoning.
- **Designing** creative algorithms that can understand and generate patterns.
- **Applying** computer vision techniques to solve grid-based puzzles.

## ðŸ“Š Results

We will update this section as we make progress in our project, showcasing our findings, techniques, and results on the ARC tasks.
